# Successive Approximation ADC

I designed a Successive Approximation ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) for use on an ATMega8515 microcontroller. The purpose of this ADC was to take in an input signal (0-5V tolerant) 
and approximate its value by repeatedly comparing it to a reference voltage generated by a PWM signal. Since we know the value of the signal must be within a certain range, it is possible to implement the binary
search algorithm to approximate the input voltage in as few comparisons as possible - O(log n) in the worst case.

## Step 1: Design an analog comparator for 2 DC voltage

The first component to design was a comparator that took in two voltages on the microcontrollers analog input pins and compared them.

## Step 2: Generate variable reference voltage (0-5V) by passing a PWM signal through RC Filter

In order to generate the reference voltage used by the comparator during the binary search algorithm, a PWM signal was generated by the board such that a pulse width of 50% corresponded to an output voltage of Vmax 
0.5 = 2.5V, etc. This way we are able to generate any voltage between [0, 5] by just adjusting the pulse width of the PWM signal.

## Step 3: Approximate input signal value (binary search)

By inputting the reference voltage at one pin and the input voltage at another, we can generate a highly accurate estimate of the input voltage by repeatedly preforming comparisons and adjusting the reference voltage 
accordingly.
